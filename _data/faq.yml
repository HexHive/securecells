    Is SecureCells trying to bring segmentation back?
  answer: >
    While the current implementation of SecureCells maps contiguous VMAs
    to contiguous physical memory regions, alternate implementations can
    remove this aspect. 
    
    Intermediate address-space mechanisms, like Midgard, are being
    by processor manufacturers, which can integrate with SecureCells and
    remove the requirement to map cells to physically contiguous memory.

  answer: >
    Probably no. These are just questions I thought might be interesting enough
    to be brought up.
